    <h4 id="Q4">4. I forgot my password. How do I get a new one?</h4>
    <p>
      Contact the MMT administrator Pekka MÃ¤kiaho at pekka.makiaho(at)uta.fi, who will send you a new password.<br /> 
      Remember to change the password after the first log in! For changing your password see <a accesskey="alt+4" href="#Q4">How can I change my password/edit my profile?</a></li>
       <br />  
       <br /> 
       <a href="#">[back to the top]</a>
    </p>

    <h4 id="Q5">5. How can I change my password/edit my profile?</h4>
    <p>
      You can change your password and edit your profile by clicking the "Profile" link at the top right corner of MMT. Make the desired changes and click "Submit".<br />
      Ps. Your password is encrypted upon submitting it. That is why it seems to have a lot more characters on the screen than what you entered. Safe and sound!
      <br />

    </p>

    <h4 id="Q6">6. As a project manager, how do I do the weekly reporting of my project?</h4>
    <p>
    A weekly report covers a calendar week. A report should be send on Monday following the weekly report week. 
    For example, if a weekly report week covers week 40 (in 2016, from October 4th to 9th), 
    the report should be sent on Monday (October 10th).
    </p>
    <p>
    You can enter the weekly project reports into MMT as follows:
      	<ul>
           <li>log in and select the project you want to enter a weekly report for</li>
	   <li>click the "Weeklyreports" tab at the top of the screen</li>
	   <li>click the "New Weeklyreport" link in the Actions pane on the left hand side</li>
	   <li>enter the weekly report data 
                <ul>
                    <li>page 1: the basic data</li>
                    <li>page 2: the metric data</li>
                    <li>page 3: the working hours of your team members</li>
                </ul>
           </li>
	   <li>if your team logs the daily working time in MMT (see <a accesskey="alt+6" href="#Q6">
	   How do I log my daily working time?</a>), the page 3 will automatically suggest the working hours of your team members</li>
	   <li>click "Submit" once you are done, and your weekly report is saved</li>
        </ul> 
      <a href="#">[back to the top]</a>
    </p>

    <h4 id="Q7">7. How do I log my daily working time?</h4>
    <p>
        You log time between Monday that follows the last weekly report week and the current day. 
        However, the first week may be different 
        as then the week starts from the day project was created instead of Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can log time late but only for the week that is covered by the last weekly report. 
        For example, if a report for week 40 was sent on Monday October 10th 2016, 
        you can still log time for week 40. However, you need to use a 'Log time late' form. 
    </p>
    <p>  
      You can log your daily working time in MMT as follows:
      	<ul >

	   <li>click the "Log time" tab at the top of the screen</li>
	   <li>click the "Log time" link on the left hand side</li>
	   <li>enter the date, description, duration (hours) and work type for the time to be logged</li>
	   <li>click "Submit" once you are done, and your logged time is saved</li>
         </ul>
     Please note that you can log time late, but only for the week of the last weekly report.
        <ul>
            <li>click the "Reports" tab at the top of the screen</li>
            <li>click the "View" link next to the last weekly report</li>
            <li>click the "Log time late" link on the left hand side menu</li>
